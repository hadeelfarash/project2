Future Saviors Self-Driving Car Project
Description
The Future Saviors team has developed and programmed a self-driving car capable of completing two distinct stages. This project showcases our achievements in autonomous vehicle technology, using various sensors and software algorithms.

Project Stages
Stage 1: Autonomous Racing
In the first stage, our self-driving car begins its journey from a specific starting location. Its objective is to complete three laps around a track and return to the initial starting point. We have successfully achieved this by employing a color sensor, which we programmed to detect and follow the blue lines on the track. The car autonomously completes three full laps after crossing 12 blue lines.

Stage 2: Colored cube avoidance
In the second stage, our self-driving car faces cubes in both red and green colors on the track. To successfully complete this stage, the car must pass the green cubes on the left and the red cubes on the right. We've achieved this by guiding the car to navigate around the green cubes on the left side and the red cubes on the right side. This task was accomplished by integrating a camera sensor and programming it using computer vision techniques. Additionally, we utilized software libraries and algorithms to support these advanced functionalities.

Obstacle Avoidance
In both stages of the project, the self-driving car is equipped with obstacle avoidance capabilities. To navigate around obstacles safely, we have integrated an ultrasonic sensor, enabling the car to detect and avoid any potential obstructions in its path.

Getting Started
To replicate our project or experiment with our code, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies and libraries.
Configure the hardware components, including the color sensor, camera sensor, and ultrasonic sensor.
Run the self-driving car code for the desired stage.
